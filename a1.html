    <h1>Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>

      <p>
        Assignment 1 was our introduction to basic circuitry
        and arduino. The goal of this assignment is to get three lights
        to blink independently and in a pattern. The picture on the left
        is the finished result of my simple first circuit.

      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <img src="a1-assets/Blink_Schematic.jpg" /> <!--Insert Schematic Here-->
      <p>
        This is a schematic of the finished circuit. From the arduino, I connected
        wires to three pins (pin 13, 12, and 11). The circuit as a whole is in parallel
        since they are different paths that go to the same ground. Each path has a 220 Ω
        resistor as well as an LED. The reason I chose 220 Ω resistors is because
        of Ohm's Law (Voltage = Current x Resistance). Each LED I chose (red, green, and yellow)
        have a voltage drop of 1.8 V and I knew that I wanted .02 A of current running through
        each path. Since the circuit is in parallel, I also knew that the voltage would be 5 V in each 
        branch. I used Ohm's law to calculate the resistance needed for each path
        which ended up being 160 Ω. I didn't have any 160 Ω resistors so I ended up using the closest
        ones I had that were higher than 160 Ω since I didn't want to burn out the LEDs.

      <pre><code>
        void setup() {
          pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // Sets an output to pin 13
          pinMode(12, OUTPUT); // Sets an output to pin 12
          pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // Sets an output to pin 11
        }

        void loop() {
          // First light on
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // Pin 13 LED is on
          digitalWrite(12, LOW); // Pin 12 is off

          // Third light on
          digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // Pin 13 is off
          digitalWrite(12, LOW); // Pin 12 is off
          digitalWrite(11, HIGH); // Pin 11 is on
          delay(1000); // The third light is on for 1 second while the others are off
        }

      <p>
        This is the arduino code that runs to blink the LEDs. In a nutshell,
        it makes it so each LED is on for 1 second while the other LEDs 
        are off. The LED is determined by what pin it's wired to as seen in the 
        schematic. The loop is set to go on forever since there's no end condition.

      <h2>Circuit Operation</h2>

      <p>
        This is what the circuit looks like when operating. The loop begins
        with the red LED, goes to the green LED, then the yellow LED, and
        then loops back to the red LED and so on.

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      
      <p><b>1. Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is 
        voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</b></p>
      <img src="a1-assets/Blink_Graph.jpg" />

      <p><br><b>2. How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? 
        How much current would that draw?</b></p>
      <p>
        The total number of pins on my arduino is 13 so it would be possible
        to attach 13 LEDs in total. But if I were to do that and I wanted .02 A of current
        to go through each branch, it would be a total of .26 A or 260 mA which is above the
        recommended amount of 200 mA from the arduino. So taking that into account, it 
        would be around 10 LEDs.
      </p>

      <p><br><b>3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can 
        tell that they are blinking?</b></p>
      <p>1 milisecond.</p>

      <p><br><b>4. AI Tools</b></p>
      <p>I used AI tools mostly for help with thinking through voltage, current, and
        resistance just to ensure that I had the right idea about building my circuit.
        It was pretty helpful in pointing me towards Ohm's Law and if I was doing my
        calculations properly.
