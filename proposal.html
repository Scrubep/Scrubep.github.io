    <h1>Final Project Proposal: Self Balancing Robot!</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Concept/Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        I remember watching a video about this robot dog made by 
        Boston Dynamics designed to patrol construction sites using its 
        cameras and sensors to collect data safely. A cool feature of 
        this robot is that when it’s pushed, it’s able to rebalance itself 
        and continue walking. I wanted to try making a low level version of 
        this by creating a two-wheeled self balancing robot.

      <h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Wheels</li>
            <li>2 Geared DC Motors</li>
            <li>1 Arduino Controller Board</li>
            <li>Wires</li>
            <li>Duct Tape</li>
            <li>Screws</li>
            <li>1 Accelerometer/Gyroscope Module (MPU-6050)</li>
            <li>1 Motor Driver Shield</li>
            <li>1 Battery (7.4 V lithium)</li>
            <li>Material for Casing (Plastic, Cardboard, etc.)</li>
            <li>1 Switch</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Timeline/Contingency Plans</h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create schematic and gather materials</li>
            <li>Write the code for the robot</li>
            <li>Assemble the robot and upload the code</li>
            <li>This will be done in small steps like testing the motors, testing the gyroscope/accelerometer, creating the casing for the robot (3D modeling maybe), etc.</li>
            <li>I’ll also be sure to take different safety precautions since we’re working in higher voltages</li>
            <li>Debug and rebuild until it works</li>
            <li>If something goes wrong with any materials (short circuit, malfunction, etc.), I will be sure to have some extras on me</li>
        </ul>
